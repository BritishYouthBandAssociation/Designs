# Designs
Design documents for each component of the system

## What to put here?
This repo wraps all the design files (Figma mockups, wireframes, photoshop etc) for all of our projects. It will also store the main branding set (fonts, colours, etc).

It is NOT a place for code.

## Structure
Each repo will have its own top-level directory. Within this directory, there will then be subdirectories for the type of file.
For example, for a "event" module with Figma files and PDF renderings, the structure would look like this:

```
/
+-- event
|   +-- Figma
|   |   +-- homepage.fig
|   |   +-- login.fig
|   +-- PDF
|   |   +-- homepage.pdf
|   |   +-- login.pdf
```
